            My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was three years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.

            I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favourite author, Enid Blyton who writes “ The Famous Five and The Secret Seven” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.

            I read at least two hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home.
